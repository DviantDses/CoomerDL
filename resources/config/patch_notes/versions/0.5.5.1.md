## Patch Note - Downloader Update

# New Features:
- Connection Retry Handling: A new method `safe_request` has been implemented that manages HTTP connection retries with exponential backoff. This change enhances the robustness of the downloader against transient network errors or rate limit constraints imposed by external servers.

# Improvements:
- Detailed Logs on Retries: Logs now include specific details about retries, including the attempt number and the waiting time before the next retry. This facilitates tracking connection issues and managing retry configurations.

# Bug Fixes:
- Improved Handling of HTTP and Connection Errors: Handling specific errors like `ConnectionError`, `HTTPError`, and `TooManyRedirects` has been centralized in the `safe_request` method. This prevents abrupt failures in the application and allows more effective recovery in case of temporary issues with HTTP requests.

# Technical Details:
- Exponential Increase in Wait Time: The wait time between retries increases exponentially, starting at 1 second and doubling with each retry, up to a maximum of 5 attempts. This approach is designed to alleviate server load and reduce the likelihood of encountering 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.

# Operational Changes:
- Download Process Revision: Downloads now utilize the `safe_request` method for better management of potential interruptions. Additional logic has been added to cleanly handle download cancellations during retries.
